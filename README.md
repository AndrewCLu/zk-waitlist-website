# ZK Waitlist Frontend

## TODO
- Empty all input forms when submit is clicked
- Replace redeemable state in Redeem with commitments + index
- Maybe get rid of all state vars like 'setDisplayRedeemable' - just have them be inferred
- Dont fetch all waitlist contract state on update - ex: max waitlist spots cannot change
- Use lock/redeem error pages for all errors - remove alerting/logging and display errors in errors page
