# ZK Waitlist Frontend

## TODO
- Dont fetch all waitlist contract state on update - ex: max waitlist spots cannot change
- Use lock/redeem error pages for all errors - remove alerting/logging and display errors in errors page
- Display claimed nullifiers (change contract to also hold list of nullifiers)
